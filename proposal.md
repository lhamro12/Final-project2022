# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Quizzes to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you take a couople quizzes on what marvel charcater you would be along with how big of a marvel fan are you.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My software will launch a website that has different marvel quizzes to chose from and complete for their enjoyment. One quiz I will have is "What Marvel Charcter Are You?" that will give you an answer depending on what the person's answers to the questions. There will be a certain amount of questions (i'm thinkign around 10 questions) an depending on those answers there are different vharcter sto match with the responses. I will also have a "How Big of a Marvel Fan Are You? quiz that will determine by how many questions you get right, how big of a fan you are. The hope is to be able to have adusios and videos in this quiz as well to have some visual questions. For example, "what movie is this clip from?" would show a clip and then there would be multiple choice answers for them to chose from. I will download a framwork to get the website started and then make the tree of code to match the answers to the charcters.



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good out come for my final project is I get the website running and have one quiz to chose from.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my project would eb to have the website runnign and have at least two differnt quizzes avaliable. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be I have the website running, multiple quizzes, and having multiple pictures/audios to add to the whole website.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are going to be programming the website and nailing down how to do that as a whole. I have to install a framework to be able to code the website to be able to create the website. I need to create a dynamic webpage that will read user input and when the user hits submit, it will go through the through the framework and give the response. I have heard of Django so I think I will install that and work on my website as a whole. I will also need to make sure that my marvel facts are all good and correct to make the quizzes. I also will probably have to watch some of the movies to refresh on their personalities and on different aspects of the movies.
