# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

One idea I have is for someone to type in a holiday and it would display a greeting card for that holiday. It would print out an image saying Happy Holidays, or something along those lines. Then also images that portray that holiday.

My other idea is to do something like a buzzfeed quiz for marvel to see what marvel character you are or to see if their a true marvel fan. Also it could be to see if they're a marvel or dc fan.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I just want to make sure they're not to simple for the project like you had said.
